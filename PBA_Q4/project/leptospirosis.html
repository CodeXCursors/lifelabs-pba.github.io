                                <p>Leptospirosis is a blood infection caused by the Leptospira, a genus of spirochaete bacteria. Leptospirosis is thought to be originating from Asia and was first discovered from sewage workers during the 1880s. As Leptospirosis does not affect the bones, it cannot be identified in bone remains of a person.</p>

                                <p>Leptospirosis is spread through animal urine, most likely from rodents, and becomes more communicable in floods. Leptospirosis averagely infects 60,000 people every year, most of which are sewage workers and typhoon victims (due to floods).</p>

                                <p>Symptoms of Leptospirosis appear usually after 1-2 weeks of infection. Leptospirosis has two phases: acute or leptospiremic phase and the immune phase. Leptospirosis causes several symptoms (sometimes asymptomatic), it usually begins with normal fever along with chills, headaches, severe muscle aches, and abdominal pain. Leptospirosis usually affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, it sometimes causes pain behind the eyes making it sensitive to light. More symptoms include vomiting, jaundice (yellowness of skin and eyes), red eyes, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane of the brain and spinal cord, which together, causes fever and headache), and severe rash (which is rarely found in Leptospirosis patients).</p>

                                <p>Leptospirosis becomes obvious when jaundice together with conjunctival suffusion (basically bleeding of conjunctiva, a frontal part of the eye) appears, which causes bleeding and yellowness of the sclera. Usually, Weil’s disease (a basic form of Leptospirosis) causes liver damage (general cause of jaundice), bleeding, kidney damage, and temporary brain damage (sometimes).</p>

                                <p>Scientists up to this day are still gathering information and knowledge about the symptoms of Leptospirosis, its causes, and how it infects the brain, eye, kidney, and lung. We need enough knowledge about Leptospirosis to know what actions to perform if diagnosed with one, many people have died from Leptospirosis, even though a large percentage of them have recovered from Leptospirosis, it is still a danger to communities.</p>

                                <p>Leptospirosis doesn’t affect the daily lives of people commonly, since it is rarely transmitted, but it is possible that Leptospirosis has affected and ruined countless families and lives. We still don’t know when Leptospirosis cases may rise, or when it may also infect you.</p>
