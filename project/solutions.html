                                <p>Leptospirosis is treated and cured by antibiotics, such as doxycycline and penicillin, which must be consumed once symptoms of Leptospirosis show up. Normal antibiotics may not cure severe Leptospirosis. Doctors treat severe Leptospirosis with intravenous antibiotics.</p>

                                <p>To prevent Leptospirosis, avoid having contact with liquid substances and soil which may be contaminated with animal urine. Also avoid solid objects which are also contaminated with animal urine, such as bottles containing one. If contact is made, thoroughly wash the area of contact (most likely hands) immediately. Not washing has a high chance of resulting in Leptospirosis. Animals often pee in rivers, lakes, and swamps. Such areas contain high concentration of Leptospira, which causes Leptospirosis. Because of this, many people avoid rivers, lakes, and swamps that are crowded with animals, especially rodents such as mice.</p>

                                <p>If you are to contact liquid or objects contaminated with animal urine, wear protection gloves, boots, and/or masks. Donâ€™t wear protection equipment that is broken, like equipment with holes or dirty equipment that may enhance the possibility of getting infected.</p>

                                <h3 class="uk-card-title">Typhoon Ulysses #1</h3>
                                <p>Typhoons can contain high winds and can cause storm surges that can ravage beaches. For typhoons, the best solution is to plant more trees because the trees absorb and store rainwater, which reduce runoff and sediment deposit after storms. They help the groundwater supply recharge prevent the transport of chemicals into streams and prevent flooding.</p>
