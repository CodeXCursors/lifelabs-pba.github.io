                                <p>A Typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. The wind collects moisture and rises, if it's cold it moves below. Which creates pressure and makes the wind fast that's why it rotates fast around a center called an eye. On the 11th of November 2020, Typhoon Ulysses lashed the mainland of Luzon. Since in the Philippines November has an average temperature of 30.5°C. An ocean can be warm if the temperature is equal or above 26°C. The typhoon has a sustained wind of 150km and was announced to be a deadly Category-4.</p>

                                <p>This typhoon has caused whipping destructive winds and dumping torrential rainfall over a wide area, triggering the extensive flooding in the several areas which led to further displacement and increased the hardship of the people. Almost thousands of homes in the national capital were submerged in roof-level floods, trapping most of the residents in their rooftops while waiting for a rescue. Not only that, the heavy rains and winds have caused the high turbidity of the water in the dam which has led to service interruptions, as the high winds toppled over the power lines cutting off the electricity in the household of the people.</p>
